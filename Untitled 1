while doing programme thing to remember is  as follows//
only elements and function in main methods get printed
while using void case always print return statment
object creation farmula is like 
/////classname.variable=new classname.();
function called as follows
/////classname.method();
non parameterised is in which in void () this is blank
while in parametersied void()we write inside this box.
